# Cloudflare Workers in Rust

`todo`

## WebAssembly

`workers-rs` (the Rust SDK for Cloudflare Workers used in this template) is meant to be executed as compiled WebAssembly, and as such so **must** all the code you write and depend upon. All crates and modules used in Rust-based Workers projects have to compile to the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` triple.

Read more about this on the [`workers-rs`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-rs) project README.
